# Memory Vault

Your coding agents don't share a memory. Memory Vault gives them one — teach Claude Code a convention, leave mid-task, and Codex picks up exactly where it stopped. No database, no embeddings: plain Markdown files on your machine, wired to every agent over MCP with one command.

Memory Vault stores facts as ordinary Markdown files. Each project gets an isolated memory space, while `shared/` holds facts that apply across projects. The files stay on your machine and remain usable if you change models or agent harnesses.

## How it works

The MCP server gives an agent six file operations: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `delete`, and `rename`.

The agent uses those tools to maintain small memory files and a `MEMORY.md` index. There is no database, vector search, or embedding model. The Markdown files are the source of truth, so you can read, edit, grep, or version them yourself.

```text
memory/
  MEMORY.md          # index of project spaces
  shared/
    MEMORY.md        # cross-project facts
    *.md
  <project>/
    MEMORY.md        # project index
    *.md
```

A project connection can access its own directory and `shared/`, but not other projects. An unscoped connection can access the whole vault for cross-project maintenance.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- An MCP client that supports stdio (global install) or Streamable HTTP (per-repo install)

Memory Vault has no runtime dependencies.

## Install globally (recommended)

Wire every harness on your machine once:

```sh
npx -y memory-vault install --global
```

For each detected harness this writes a user-level stdio MCP registration and the memory ritual in its global rules file — Claude Code (`~/.claude.json` + `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`), Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`), Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml` + `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`), and DeepSeek Harness (`~/.dsh/AGENTS.md` + a stdio mount in every profile's `cordis.patch.yml`). After that, every session in every repository gets the vault with no per-repo setup: the harness spawns `memory-vault stdio` in the session's directory, and the server derives the project space from that directory automatically (the nearest `.git`, else the shallowest package manifest; no marker means the `default` space). Detected spaces are recorded in `~/.memory-vault-connections.json` so they stay stable.

```sh
npx -y memory-vault install --global --dry-run        # preview changes
npx -y memory-vault install --global --store <dir>    # choose the store (default ~/.memory-vault)
npx -y memory-vault uninstall --global                # undo exactly what install wrote
```

Restart your sessions after installing. Per-repo `install` (below) remains for team-shared, committed configs or a custom space name.

## Install into a repository

Run this from the repository you want to connect:

```sh
npx -y memory-vault install
```

This command:

1. Starts the local server if it is not already running.
2. Asks which harnesses to wire up, with the detected ones pre-selected (interactive terminals only — everywhere else the detected set is used as is).
3. Writes each chosen harness's MCP config and the shared rules files.

By default, `install` stores memory in `~/.memory-vault` and derives the project name from the current directory. `connect` is an alias for `install`.

```sh
npx -y memory-vault install --dry-run                # preview changes
npx -y memory-vault install --project my-app         # choose the project name
npx -y memory-vault install --harness claude,codex   # skip the prompt, pick explicitly
npx -y memory-vault install --yes                    # skip the prompt, accept detected
```

Restart your agent session after installing and approve the `vault` MCP server if prompted.

## Uninstall from a repository

```sh
npx -y memory-vault uninstall
```

Removes everything `install` wrote to the repository — the MCP entries, the rules sections, the dsh patch — deleting a file only when it held nothing else. Your memories are never touched, and the server keeps running for other projects. `disconnect` is an alias for `uninstall`.

## Check the wiring

```sh
npx -y memory-vault status
```

Shows whether the server is up and which store it serves, how the current repository is wired per harness, and every repository recorded by `install` (kept in `~/.memory-vault-connections.json`). If the server is up and the repo is wired but your agent session has no vault tools, the remaining cause is session attachment — `status` prints how to fix it.

### Supported harnesses

| Harness | Files configured |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json`, `AGENTS.md` |
| Codex | `.codex/config.toml`, `AGENTS.md` |
| DeepSeek Harness | `dsh-cordis.patch.yml` |

For DSH, start a session with the generated patch:

```sh
dsh --patch ./dsh-cordis.patch.yml --profile headless "your task"
```

## Run the server directly

```sh
MEMORY_DIR=~/.memory-vault npx memory-vault
```

The server listens on `127.0.0.1:8787` by default.

| Environment variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MEMORY_DIR` | `./memory` | Directory containing the vault |
| `VAULT_PORT` | `8787` | Local HTTP port |

From a cloned repository, `npm start` runs the same server.

### MCP endpoints

```text
POST /mcp/<project>  project memory plus shared memory
POST /mcp            whole-vault access
```

For example, a manual Claude Code connection is:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http --scope project vault http://localhost:8787/mcp/my-project
```

## Memory format

Store one durable fact per Markdown file:

```md
---
name: preferred-language
description: The project's preferred implementation language
---

Use TypeScript for new application code.
```

Add a pointer to the space's `MEMORY.md`:

```md
- [preferred-language](preferred-language.md) — use TypeScript for new application code
```

The server instructs agents to check for an existing memory before creating one, update facts instead of duplicating them, and remove memories that become incorrect.

## Current scope

The current release is a local Markdown store, an MCP interface, and a cross-harness setup command. There is no automatic extraction, semantic search, deduplication, authentication, or remote deployment.
